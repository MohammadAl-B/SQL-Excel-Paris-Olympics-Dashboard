# SQL | Excel â€“ Paris Olympics Dashboard
By: Mohammad Al Bayyari

- I chose to use the recent Paris Olympics 2024 as my primary resource and used websites such as Kaggle and Olympics.com for my datasets.

- I then created a Dashboard for the data I will be storing via PowerPoint and extracted it as a jpg file to use in Excel later.

- I then wrote down in a temporary Excel sheet the data and sections that I would be looking to add onto my dashboard for a visual representation of some
  key statistics from the recent Olympics.

- After creating a plan and layout for what I was looking for. I went on to add some of the datasets to the excel sheets. I cleaned the data and removed unnecessary
  information from the tables that were provided. 

- After doing the first initial cleaning. I imported the new csv files into MySQL and coded all of the required data that I would be needing for my Excel formulas. 
  This way I would know what I was looking for numerically in Excel and also documented all of the SQL code with screenshots of the results into a Word Document for Storage.

- Once I had everything coded. I went back to Excel and started cleaning the Data a second time. This time I added columns to my tables and added information that I now would
  need to formulate my data to achieve the required output. Then I created pivot tables of the separate tables and created graphs and charts of the data that needed to be showcased.

- Finally, I put all of the graphs, charts, and data onto the Dashboard sheet. 
  I then adjusted the colors to make it visually appealing and added text to the sections for ease of use.

That would conclude my project. You can find the finished project in the Excel File named PO2024 Completed Project.xlsx
